The means of each of these samples (denoted by $\\overline{x}$) are $125, 150, 125, 175, 150, 175$. Therefore, the random variable $\\overline{X}$ can take $125, 150, 175$ as values. Now each of values are equally likely, therefore $p(\\overline{X} = 125) = p(\\overline{X} = 150) = p(\\overline{X} = 175) = \\frac{1}{3}$. The mean of a discrete random variable is given by,\n",

        "\n",
        "A hypothesis is based on available information and the investigator's belief about the population parameters. The process of hypothesis testing involves setting up two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. One selects a random sample (or multiple samples when there are more comparison groups), computes summary statistics and then assesses the likelihood that the sample data support the research or alternative hypothesis. In other words, a hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. It helps us claim a finding to be statistically significant (can often be useful while claiming validity of experimental results). Let us now see four most widely used hypothesis testing methods. \n",

        "\n",
        "The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed. A p value is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis (accept the research hypothesis). Generally p-value $<$ than $0.05$ is considered to be enough to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
